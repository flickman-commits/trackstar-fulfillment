/**
 * GET /api/orders/gift-stats?days=30
 *
 * What share of recent orders were bought as gifts.
 *
 * The signal is already in our database: the personalization wizard asks the
 * shopper outright and we store the answer as Order.isGift, so this needs no
 * Shopify call. Shopify separately tags some orders "gift" and the two agree
 * on 96% of orders, but isGift is the customer's own explicit answer, which is
 * the thing actually being measured here.
 *
 * Two counting decisions that change the number:
 *
 * 1. PER ORDER, not per line item. Our Order rows are one per printed item, so
 *    a three-print order would otherwise count three times and a customer who
 *    buys more prints would weigh more than one who buys one.
 *
 * 2. The denominator is orders that were ASKED. The wizard writes a "Gift"
 *    property on every order it handles, so its absence means the question was
 *    never put to that shopper (older orders, Etsy, some custom flows).
 *    Counting those as "not a gift" would understate the rate - 58% against
 *    69% on the current window - by treating "we never asked" as a no.
