/**
 * Public, unauthenticated "does this race have an instant lookup?" probe.
 *
 *   GET /api/public/race-status?race=Bayshore+Marathon+Personalized+Race+Print
 *   -> { hasLookup: false, raceCanonical: "Bayshore Marathon" }
 *
 * The storefront wizard calls this once when it initialises, so it knows which
 * flow it is running BEFORE the shopper types anything. Without it the widget
 * had to submit a real lookup to discover a race has no scraper, which showed a
 * spinner and a pause on its way to a manual-entry flow that was never in doubt.
 *
 * Deliberately does no scraping and touches no upstream timing site: it reads
 * the deployed race configs and returns. That makes it far cheaper than
 * results-lookup, so it gets its own rate-limit bucket with a much higher
 * ceiling (sharing the scraper's 20/hour would let a few product-page views
 * exhaust a shopper's real lookup budget) and a CDN cache, since the answer
 * only changes when we deploy a new config.
