/**
 * GET /api/products/pricing
 *
 * Landed cost, price and margin for every size/frame, at a given order size.
 *
 *   ?quantity=1            units in ONE shipment (see below)
 *   ?shippingDestination=US
 *
 * Quantity means units per SHIPMENT, not units sold, and that distinction is
 * the whole reason the bulk view exists:
 *
 *   Retail DTC — every order ships on its own, so quantity is 1 no matter how
 *                many prints we sell in a month.
 *   Bulk       — wholesale and charity orders go out as one consignment, so
 *                shipping, package branding and the flat 30c payment fee are
 *                all divided across the run.
 *
 * Production cost does not move with quantity (Artelo gives no volume break),
 * so quoting bulk off the qty-1 numbers overstates cost, sometimes badly.
 *
 * Channel pricing (wholesale discount, charity terms) is applied client-side
 * on top of `retailPrice`, so changing terms costs no round trip and nothing
 * about a negotiation gets baked into the server.
