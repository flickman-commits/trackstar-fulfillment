/**
 * Static lint for scraper fixtures.
 *
 * Runs as part of `npm run build` to catch the case where a developer
 * adds a new scraper platform but forgets to add a chip-time fixture.
 *
 * Fast (no network calls) — just file reads + import checks.
 *
 * Fails the build if:
 *   - A platform under server/scrapers/platforms/ has no fixture
 *   - A scraper config file fails to import
 *
 * The actual chip-time correctness is verified by:
 *   - scripts/verify-scraper-chip-times.js (manual, network-dependent)
 *   - the weekly health-check cron
