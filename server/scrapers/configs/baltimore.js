/**
 * Baltimore Running Festival (Baltimore Marathon) — marathon + half, October.
 * SVE Timing platform (US Sports Timing), organizer Corrigan Sports.
 * Results: https://results.svetiming.com/Corrigan-Sports-Enterprises/events/{year}/baltimore-running-festival/results
 *
 * Every year from 2021 to 2026 is live at that URL with no per-year id to look
 * up — the year IS the path segment — so there is no eventIds map here and no
 * chance of a year silently borrowing another year's event.
 *
 * Division names are stable across years but the field includes a lot we do
 * not sell prints for: MARATHON RIM and HALF MARATHON RIM (wheelchair),
 * HANDCYCLE variants, 10K, 5K and the "Balti-MORON-a-thon" novelty entry. The
 * patterns below are anchored so "MARATHON" cannot swallow "MARATHON RIM" or
 * "MARATHON HANDCYCLE" and hand back a wheelchair time as a running time.
 *
 * Verified finisher: see chip-time-fixtures.js (Baltimore 2025).
