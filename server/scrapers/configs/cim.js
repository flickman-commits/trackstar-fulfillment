   * Verified dates. There is no calculateDate here on purpose.

   * The old rule was "first Sunday of December", and it is wrong in exactly
   * the years December 1st is itself a Sunday: it returns Dec 1 for 2019 and
   * for 2024, when the race was actually held on Dec 8 both times. That is a
   * full week off, on the date printed on the poster and on the date the
   * weather is looked up from, and it looks entirely plausible.
   *
   * A year not listed here now resolves to no date at all rather than to a
   * confident guess. That is the point: a missing date is visible and gets
   * fixed, a wrong one ships.
