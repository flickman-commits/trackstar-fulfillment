/**
 * Jersey City Marathon - RTRT platform
 * Tracker: https://track.rtrt.me/e/JCM-JERSEYCITYMARATHON-{YYYY}
 *
 * Jersey City switched from RunSignUp to RTRT starting in 2026. RTRT has no
 * event for 2023-2025 (it answers "Invalid Event Name"), so those years are
 * served by the RunSignUp fallback below.
 *
 * Event contains both Marathon and Half Marathon participants mixed.
 * The RTRT profiles API returns ALL runners in one response — we
 * distinguish between marathon and half via the `course` field on
 * each profile ("marathon" vs "halfmarathon").
 *
 * Held on a Sunday in mid-April, but the date moves — do not derive one from
 * that pattern; every year needs a source naming the calendar day.
 * Confirmed: 2026-04-19
 *
 * There is no 2022 entry because there was no 2022 race. The inaugural running
 * was 2023-04-23 (TAPinto, "Inaugural Jersey City Marathon Set for April 23,
 * 2023" + Jersey City Upfront's 2022 piece on the race being planned for 2023).
 * The lint's COVERED_YEARS is a blanket range, so it will keep reporting 2022 as
 * an unpinned year and the sweep will keep listing it as an untested race-year.
 * Both are artifacts of that blanket assumption. Do not pin a 2022 date to make
 * them quiet — there is no day to find.
