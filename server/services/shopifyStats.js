/**
 * Storefront stats, computed from Shopify orders rather than our own database.
 *
 * Our Order rows are one per printed ITEM and only exist for orders we have
 * imported, so they are the wrong denominator for anything expressed as "what
 * share of orders". Shopify is the source of truth for what was actually
 * bought, so these read from it directly.
 *
 * ─── Adding a metric ───
 *
 * Add one object to METRICS. It gets the same already-fetched, already-filtered
 * order list every other metric sees and returns a numerator, a denominator and
 * a note. Nothing else needs touching - the endpoint and the dashboard both
 * iterate whatever is in the list.
 *
 * ─── Denominators ───
 *
 *   Gift rate. The order's Shopify TAG, over every order in the window. An
 *   earlier version read a line-item "Gift" property, which is how the store
 *   used to record this and is no longer the source of truth. The tag is set
 *   per order and needs no interpretation - a blank property once forced a
 *   choice between 66% and 84% depending on how you read a non-answer, and this
 *   has no such ambiguity.
 *
 *   Photo add-on. Orders containing the "Photo Add-On" product, over every
 *   order placed since the add-on went live. Matched by TITLE because that
 *   product carries no SKU.
 *
 *   There is deliberately no eligibility test. An earlier version tried to
 *   filter the denominator to "orders containing a print", first by SKU pattern
 *   and then by title. The SKU pattern was not reliable - prints are usually
 *   `...-s1p-...` but Personalized Chicago ships as plain `chi` - and in
 *   practice essentially every order contains a print anyway, so the filter
 *   excluded nothing while adding a way to be wrong. Every order counts.
 *
 *   The denominator IS clamped to the launch date, which is a different thing:
 *   orders placed before the add-on existed could not have bought it, and
 *   leaving them in makes the rate read low for no reason.
