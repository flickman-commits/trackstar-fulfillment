/**
 * The nightly sweep: everything about the fulfillment tool's health that can
 * be established by code alone.
 *
 * This file deliberately contains NO judgment. It gathers facts and returns
 * them. Deciding what to do about a fact - look a race date up, write a
 * config, wake Matt - is the agent's job, and it reads this report over the
 * admin API. The split matters: this half runs with production credentials on
 * Vercel, the agent half never sees them and can only write code.
 *
 * Everything here is READ-ONLY except the catalog sync, which is idempotent
 * and already runs on its own staleness timer.
 *
 * Two rules that shape the whole file:
 *
 *   1. No invented problems. Every finding is a concrete fact with an order
 *      number or a race attached. "Looks unusual" is not a finding. A sweep
 *      that cries wolf gets ignored, and then the real one is missed too.
 *
 *   2. Failure is a finding. If a check throws, that is reported as a broken
 *      check rather than silently omitted. A clean report must mean "we
 *      looked", never "we could not look". The stale catalog sat unnoticed for
 *      eighteen days precisely because nothing said it had stopped moving.
