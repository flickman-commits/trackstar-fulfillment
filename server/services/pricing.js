/**
 * pricing.js - Landed cost, price and margin for every size/frame we sell,
 * across sales channels.
 *
 * Two live sources, no hardcoded money:
 *   - Artelo's pricing API for production + shipping (see arteloCosts.js)
 *   - Shopify for the current retail price of each size/frame
 *
 * Costs reconcile to ARTELO, which is who actually fulfills our orders. If a
 * second print partner is ever adopted, its costs belong behind the same
 * fetchArteloCost seam rather than being pasted in as constants — the point of
 * this file is that no money is typed by hand except a negotiated discount.
 *
 * WHAT SCALES WITH QUANTITY AND WHAT DOES NOT is the whole point of the bulk
 * view, and Artelo does not make it obvious:
 *
 *   production  PER UNIT   — flat, no volume break (36.34 at qty 1 and at 50)
 *   shipping    PER ORDER  — 9.75 for one 12x18, 61.20 for fifty, so per-unit
 *                            shipping falls from $9.75 to $1.22
 *   branding    PER ORDER  — $0.80 once, however many prints are in the box
 *
 * So bulk economics come almost entirely from shipping and branding being
 * amortized, not from a production discount. Quoting a bulk order off the
 * qty-1 numbers overstates cost badly at volume.
