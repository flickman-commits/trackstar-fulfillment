/**
 * The repair half of Trackstar MCP: the tools the nightly agent needs to
 * actually fix things, rather than only report on them.
 *
 * These are gated behind a SECOND credential (MCP_WRITE_TOKEN). The read tools
 * sit behind MCP_TOKEN and are meant to be on a phone; these change production
 * and are meant for one scheduled routine. Same server, two doors, because a
 * connector is reachable from every session that enables it and "my phone can
 * capture a fixture against a timing site" is not a thing anyone asked for.
 *
 * Even here, nothing destructive is exposed. There is no clearing research, no
 * merging races, no pricing, no messaging a customer. The worst these can do is
 * make some requests to timing sites and write a scraper-health row.
 *
 * ─── The sweep pair ───
 *
 * run_sweep / finish_sweep exist as a pair so the agent never has to carry a
 * sweep report through tool arguments. A full report is ~47KB of JSON and 200
 * findings; asking a model to hold that and hand it back verbatim is a way to
 * lose data and burn context for nothing. Instead run_sweep parks the "before"
 * server-side and finish_sweep picks it up, re-sweeps, and works out what
 * changed. The agent carries a summary and its own notes, which is all it
 * actually reasons about.
